# Medicine Inventory Management Web Application

## Introduction
This project involves the development of a web application for managing medicine inventory within a company. The application provides role-based authentication for three user roles: CEO, Store Manager, and User. Each role has distinct functionalities tailored to their responsibilities, including overseeing workers and inventory, managing orders, and tracking order statuses.
